# We have created a tic-tac-toe game ! 

if you want a faster and better way to play the game, here it is : https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe&rlz=1C5CHFA_enFR793FR793&oq=tic+tac+toe&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3j0l2.1956j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

## We are learning how to code thanks to theleraningproject.com 

## Today's project was to create a tic-tac-toe game using ruby and the MVC method. 
## AND IT WAS AWESOME ! 
## Here it's how we feel about it :

We arrived to manage it, and the code works well. 
We created 6 class : 1 router, 1 controller(game), 3 models(board, boardcase, player) and 1 view(show)

Finally, we don't really use the boardcase, the code works without it. 
I guess because we manage to link the choice of the players with the index of the case that we directly put inside our table thanks to the terminal::table gem. 

Well, we still have a little problem, some winning combinaison doesn't stop the game. 
It looks like, if the 3 numbers are ordered from big to small, the program have trouble to understand it... 
for exemple, 
on this board 1 2 3
              4 5 6
              7 8 9
if one player had the winning combination 7, 5, 3, it won't reconize it, but it will reconize the 1, 2, 3 's.
Well it's a small thing to correct, but we were exhausted and wanted to go home to rest :D 

Finnally, we managed to use all we learned in the last 2 weeks and it was a pleasure to make it happen. 
We saw how much we progress and how confident we are writting, reading and understanding all ruby's concept and logique.
Well, still have much to do to be a good ruby programmer, but we feel good after this 2 weeks :D 

Enjoy
